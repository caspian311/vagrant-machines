##Vagrant Servers

This is a repo so I can keep track of my servers. My hope is to eliminate all the stupid VirtualBox configurations I have to do everytime I setup a new project.

Provisioning to come later.

### Startup Couchbase server

    cd couchbase
    vagrant up

### Startup Node server

    cd node
    vagrant up
