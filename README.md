#Vagrant Machines

This is a place where I can store all my configurations for my weird experiements. So each folder under here should represent one project of mine. Using Vagrant (and assuming no other machines are running), I should be able to just run ```vagrant up``` in the corresponding folder and get stuff back to what I need. That's the goal anyway.
